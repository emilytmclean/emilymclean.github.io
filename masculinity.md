## Meditations on Masculinity

> This essay predates my transition, and was my attempt at the time to interrogate my own complex feelings surrounding masculinity.

As the visibility of the LGBTQI+ community has increased over the past century, the question of who gets to call themselves a man is an 
increasingly contentious and public debate. In the past decade alone, we've seen the rise of reactionary anti-feminist, pro-traditional masculinity
movements like "Gamergate" or the hypermasculine grandstanding of Trump's politics. In light of these movements, I wanted to spend some time
interrogating the motivations behind these movements, as well as my own relationship with masculinity.

It makes sense to first define the form of masculinity to which these reactionary groups are calling for a return. Although there may be minor
differences between the ideologies, the vast majority share a belief that today's men are weakend, overshadowed by their privileged female counterparts,
and the sickness that has swept up society can only be resolved to a prelapsarian, idyllic form of masculinity, generally sometime around the 1940s and 50s.
It's not suprising they pick this period, it was one in which the United States was experiencing an unprecedented period of economic prosperity and, more
importantly, was before the forms of masculinity they consider "feminine" became widely tolerated. As the thought goes, back then men were aggressive, stoic, 
athletic, financially successful, and maintained a "healthy" nuclear family. The uniformity of the nuclear family across society is particularly important 
to these groups, who often attribute any variety of societal problems to the demise, and subsequent rise of alternative family structures.

One of the key figures in the so-called "Mens Rights Activist" movement is Warren Farrell, who's book *The Myth of Male Power* is often credited with the 
creation of the movement. He too focuses on the demise of the nuclear family, and the family where the husband is the sole financial provider. He argues 
that, following their loss of exclusive jurisdiction over positions of power or work, men have also lost their sense of purpose and have consequently 
fallen into a form of nihilistic depression. The increasing prevalence of young men failing to “launch” is attributed to the rise in single 
mother/fatherless families since the 1950s. He further suggests that increased male participation in traditional nuclear families would benefit 
both fathers and sons, giving fathers a unique purpose and sons a strong role model. While I find this to be an interesting argument, I think it is ultimately
a flawed one. The nuclear family has really only been the hegemonic form of the familial structure in certain cultures and time periods, with other family structures like ["extended family" historically being the more popular structure](https://www.npr.org/2018/05/13/610777733/parenting-myths-and-facts). Moreso, I think Farrell fails to establish any inherent quality of men and women that the opposite gender cannot emulate.
